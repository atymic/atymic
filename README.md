### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a freelance software developer building robust software solutions for clients large and small. My passion is building well architected, maintainable, and tested web applications using Laravel.

On the front end side, I love working with Vue.js & Tailwind CSS to build beautiful, interactive and accessible products.

I maintain multiple large open source projects including [Laravel Notifcation Channels](https://laravel-notification-channels.com/), [Laravel Socialite Providers](https://socialiteproviders.com/), [GeocoderPHP](https://geocoder-php.org/) and a whole bunch more.
